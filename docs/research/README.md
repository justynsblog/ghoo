# Research Documentation Archive

This directory contains research and analysis documents created during ghoo's design and development phases. These documents provide historical context and rationale for technical decisions.

## Overview

These research documents were created during the initial development phases to:
- Analyze GitHub API capabilities and limitations
- Evaluate different technical approaches
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Validate implementation strategies

**Note:** These are historical documents preserved for reference. For current implementation details, see the [Development Documentation](../development/README.md).

## Research Documents

### GitHub API Analysis

#### [GraphQL Analysis](./graphql-analysis.md)
**Created:** Phase 1 - Initial Research  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of GitHub's GraphQL API capabilities  
**Key findings:** Schema exploration, query patterns, rate limiting, feature availability  
**Relevance:** Foundation for hybrid REST/GraphQL approach

#### [GraphQL Mutation Analysis](./graphql-mutation-analysis.md)
**Created:** Phase 1 - API Research  
**Purpose:** Deep dive into GraphQL mutations for issue management  
**Key findings:** Mutation capabilities, sub-issue creation, Projects V2 integration  
**Relevance:** Informed create command implementations

#### [Sub-Issues Analysis](./sub-issues-analysis.md)
**Created:** Phase 1 - Feature Research  
**Purpose:** Investigation of GitHub's sub-issue functionality  
**Key findings:** GraphQL-only availability, repository requirements, fallback strategies  
**Relevance:** Led to label-based fallback implementation

#### [Projects V2 Analysis](./projects-v2-analysis.md)
**Created:** Phase 1 - Feature Research  
**Purpose:** Evaluation of Projects V2 for status management  
**Key findings:** Field types, automation capabilities, API access patterns  
**Relevance:** Influenced status management design

### Design Evaluations

#### [System Design Evaluation](./system-design-evaluation.md)
**Created:** Phase 2 - Architecture Review  
**Purpose:** Validation of overall system architecture  
**Key findings:** Component responsibilities, data flow validation, scalability assessment  
**Relevance:** Confirmed architectural decisions

#### [Code Quality Evaluation](./code-quality-evaluation.md)
**Created:** Phase 3 - Implementation Review  
**Purpose:** Assessment of code quality and best practices  
**Key findings:** Type safety validation, error handling patterns, test coverage analysis  
**Relevance:** Established quality standards

## Reading Guide

### For Understanding Design Decisions
1. Start with [GraphQL Analysis](./graphql-analysis.md) to understand API choices
2. Review [Sub-Issues Analysis](./sub-issues-analysis.md) for hierarchy implementation
3. Check [System Design Evaluation](./system-design-evaluation.md) for architecture rationale

### For API Integration Reference
1. [GraphQL Analysis](./graphql-analysis.md) - Query patterns and capabilities
2. [GraphQL Mutation Analysis](./graphql-mutation-analysis.md) - Write operations
3. [Projects V2 Analysis](./projects-v2-analysis.md) - Status management options

### For Implementation Context
1. [System Design Evaluation](./system-design-evaluation.md) - Architecture validation
2. [Code Quality Evaluation](./code-quality-evaluation.md) - Quality standards
3. [Sub-Issues Analysis](./sub-issues-analysis.md) - Feature availability

## Historical Context

These documents were created during different phases of development:

- **Phase 1**: Initial research and API exploration (GraphQL, Sub-issues, Projects analyses)
- **Phase 2**: Architecture validation and GraphQL client implementation
- **Phase 3**: Implementation reviews and quality assessments

## Important Notes

1. **Historical Reference**: These documents reflect the state of GitHub's APIs and features at the time of writing
2. **Design Rationale**: They explain why certain technical decisions were made
3. **Not Maintenance Docs**: For current implementation details, see [Development Docs](../development/README.md)
4. **API Evolution**: GitHub's APIs may have evolved since these analyses were performed

## Using This Research

When referencing these documents:
- Consider them as historical context, not current specifications
- Check current GitHub API documentation for latest capabilities
- Refer to implementation code for actual behavior
- Use them to understand the "why" behind design decisions
