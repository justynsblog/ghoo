# E2E Test Validation Report for Create Epic Command

## Overview

The E2E tests for the `create-epic` command have been implemented but cannot be executed in the current environment due to missing dependencies and test environment setup. This report outlines what the tests are designed to validate and provides guidance for running them.

## Test Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
export TESTING_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # GitHub PAT with repo permissions
export TESTING_REPO="owner/test-repo"           # Test repository in format owner/repo
```

### Required Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- uv package manager (or pip with virtual environment)
- All project dependencies from pyproject.toml

### Test Repository Setup
The test repository should:
- Allow issue creation (write permissions for the token)
- Be dedicated for testing (issues will be created during tests)
- Have repository admin permissions if testing custom issue types

## E2E Test Coverage

### Test File: `tests/e2e/test_create_epic_e2e.py`

#### Test Cases Implemented:

1. **`test_create_epic_basic`**
   - **Purpose**: Verify basic epic creation with default template
   - **Validates**: 
     - Command succeeds with valid repo/token
     - Epic is created with correct title
     - Status:backlog label is applied
     - Issue number and URL are returned
     - Type is correctly identified as "epic"

2. **`test_create_epic_with_labels`**
   - **Purpose**: Test epic creation with additional labels
   - **Validates**:
     - Additional labels are parsed correctly
     - Labels are applied to the created issue
     - Default status:backlog is still included

3. **`test_create_epic_with_custom_body`**
   - **Purpose**: Test custom body content preservation
   - **Validates**:
     - Custom body content is used instead of template
     - Required sections validation (if config present)
     - Issue is created with custom content

4. **`test_create_epic_then_get`**
   - **Purpose**: Integration test creating then retrieving epic
   - **Validates**:
     - Epic creation succeeds
     - Created epic can be retrieved with get command
     - All metadata is preserved (title, type, labels)
     - Cross-command compatibility

5. **`test_create_epic_with_nonexistent_milestone`**
   - **Purpose**: Error handling for invalid milestone
   - **Validates**:
     - Graceful failure with clear error message
     - No partial issue creation
     - User-friendly error reporting

6. **`test_create_epic_fallback_behavior`**
   - **Purpose**: Test API fallback mechanisms
   - **Validates**:
     - Works regardless of GraphQL/REST API availability
     - Appropriate labels applied based on available features
     - Consistent behavior across API methods

7. **`test_create_epic_invalid_repo`**
   - **Purpose**: Error handling for invalid repositories
   - **Validates**:
     - Clear error messages for non-existent repos
     - Proper authentication error handling
     - No hanging or unclear failures

8. **`test_create_epic_with_assignees`**
   - **Purpose**: Test assignee functionality
   - **Validates**:
     - Assignee parsing and application
     - Graceful handling of invalid users
     - Clear feedback on assignee results

## Integration Test Coverage

### Test File: `tests/integration/test_create_epic_integration.py`

#### Key Integration Tests:

1. **Command Line Interface Tests**
   - Help text validation
   - Argument parsing verification
   - Error message consistency
   - Configuration file handling

2. **Input Validation Tests**
   - Repository format validation
   - Label/assignee parsing
   - Configuration file validation
   - Custom body processing

3. **Authentication Flow Tests**
   - Token detection and validation
   - Error handling for auth failures
   - Environment variable precedence

## Manual Validation Checklist

When E2E tests are run, verify these outcomes:

### ✅ Successful Epic Creation
- [ ] Epic issue created with correct title
- [ ] Issue type is "epic" (GraphQL) or has "type:epic" label (REST)
- [ ] Status:backlog label is applied
- [ ] Default body template is used when no custom body provided
- [ ] Issue number and URL are returned in success message

### ✅ Advanced Features
- [ ] Custom body content is preserved
- [ ] Additional labels are applied correctly
- [ ] Assignees are set (when users exist and have permissions)
- [ ] Milestone is assigned (when milestone exists)
- [ ] Configuration file validation works

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Clear error for invalid repository format
- [ ] Authentication errors are user-friendly
- [ ] Non-existent milestone produces clear error
- [ ] Invalid assignees are handled gracefully
- [ ] Network/API errors don't crash the command

### ✅ Cross-Command Integration
- [ ] Created epics can be retrieved with `ghoo get`
- [ ] Epic appears in repository issue list
- [ ] All metadata is correctly formatted in get output
- [ ] Epic hierarchy information is available

## Running the E2E Tests

### Prerequisites Setup
```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables
export TESTING_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export TESTING_REPO="your-test-org/test-repo"

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync --dev  # or pip install -e .[dev]

# 3. Run E2E tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_create_epic_e2e.py -v

# 4. Run all tests
uv run python -m pytest -v
```

### Expected Test Results
- All tests should pass with a properly configured test environment
- Test epics will be created in the test repository (manual cleanup may be needed)
- Each test includes unique timestamps to avoid conflicts

## Test Repository Cleanup

After running E2E tests, manual cleanup of created test issues may be required:
- Issues are created with unique timestamps for identification
- Search for issues with titles containing "E2E Test Epic"
- Close or delete test issues as appropriate

## Security Considerations

- Use a dedicated test repository, not production repositories
- Test token should have minimal required permissions
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Consider using GitHub Actions for automated E2E testing

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the create-epic command functionality. While not executed in this environment, the tests are designed to validate real-world usage patterns and edge cases against live GitHub repositories.

For full validation, run the tests in an environment with:
1. Required dependencies installed
2. Valid GitHub token and test repository configured  
3. Network access to GitHub API

The implementation is ready for E2E validation once the test environment is properly configured.
